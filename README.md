## Introduction

Do you have a bunch of receipts (or invoice, demand-notes, etc.) from various sources (e.g. photo of paper receipts, screen cap from PDF, email, etc.) and want to perform the following analytical activities?

- Have a tool that can extract the data and infer the expense category for you
- Your receipts contains multi-language contents (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, etc.), and various currencies
- Save those data into a database for exploration and analytics
- Group the expenses by various criterias (e.g. month, expense category, currency, etc.) and visualize it with charts

If the above is what you want to do, then this tutorial is for you!

This is a step-by-step tutorial to guide you through the process of extracting data from expense images, persist it into a local database, and analyse it with charts by dynamic criterias.

You need to have the following in order to be able to run through this tutotial:

- A laptop or desktop running MacOS
- Python (3.12 or above)
- Docker (for running Metabase)
- Sqlite DB

This tutotial tries to make the process as simple as possible, and suitable for users with less technical experience.

## Overview

This tutorial use the following components for various tasks:

- [UnderDoc](https://underdoc.io) for extracting data from receipt/invoice/demand-notes images
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.com/) for storing extracted data
- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) for expense analytics

## Prerequisite

### Get an UnderDoc API Key

The key step in this tutorial is to extract the expense information from images into structured data (e.g. shop name, amount, currency, inferred category, etc.) that is suitable for storing into a database for exploration. We will use [UnderDoc](https://underdoc.io), which is a cost effective platform (with a free tier) in performing this task. This tool also works well with multi-language images.

Using UnderDoc is simple, just signup at their developer portal and get an API key.

#### Step 1: Signup

First of all, visit the signup page at [UnderDoc Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.underdoc.io/signup)

![Signup at UnderDoc](images/underdoc-signup.png)

Enter your email, password and then confirm Sign Up.

![Confirm Signup at UnderDoc](images/underdoc-signup-confirm.png)

Upon sign up successful, you will receive an email. You need to verify your email before login.

![Email Verification at UnderDoc](images/underdoc-signup-email-verification.png)

#### Step 2: Login

Once sign up success and email verified, you can then login to [UnderDoc Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.underdoc.io/) to login.

![Login to UnderDoc](images/underdoc-login.png)

#### Step 3: Get the key from "Key Management" Page

On the left, select "Key Management".

![Login to UnderDoc](images/underdoc-key-management.png)

In the Key Management page, click the eye icon to display the key, and then copy it for use later in this tutorial.

![Reveal and Copy UnderDoc API Key](images/underdoc-copy-key.png)

Now you have the UnderDoc API key, and can proceed to the rest of the tutorial.

### Install Docker

In this tutorial, we will use Docker to run Metabase, which is a powerful open source data analytics platform. The easiest way to have Docker in your machine is to download Docker Desktop from [Docker](https://docker.com) and install it (free for personal use).

### Install Python 3.12

This tutorial was tested with Python 3.12. To install this into your Mac, the easiest way is to install via homebrew. The following is the command.

```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

### Install sqlite command line interface

The expense data extracted will be persisted to SQLite DB locally. We will use SQLite to verify the database as well as the data stored. To install, we also use homebrew.

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

This consludes all prerequisites, let's proceed to environment setup!

## Environment Setup

### Clone the project for this tutorial

All the Python scripts required, and some sample images were provided by this tutorial. Clone it from GitHub with the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/under-doc/underdoc-expense-analytics-tutorial.git
```

One cloned, change directory into the project folder. For example, my folder is as follows:

```bash
/Users/clarenceho/workspace/underdoc/underdoc-expense-analytics-tutorial
```

In this folder, you will see some folders and files. The following is an overview:

- README.md: this file
- model.py: the Python script for model classes
- main.py: the Python script for the extraction process
- requirements.txt: the Python library packages that this project requires
- receipt-images: the expense images should be put here. You can see 20 sample images provided
- metabase-data: this is where the Metabase and UnderDoc database will be stored

### Setup Python Virtual Environment and Install Required Packages

The next step is to create a Python virtual environment for this tutorial and install the required packages. Run the following commands in order.

```bash
# Step 1: Create a Python virtual environment in the folder venv using Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv venv

# Step 2: Activate the Python virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Verification

To verify the Python environment, run the following command.

```bash
pip list
```

You should see the list like one below.

### Initialize a SQLite DB (optional)

We need to have an empty SQLite DB file for storing extracted expense data. This repo already provided one (in metabase-data/underdoc.db). If you need to initialize one, run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 metabase-data/underdoc.db
```

### Copy your expense images into the folder receipt-images

The script will process all images in the folder receipt-images. You can use the sample images provide, or copy your own images into the folder for analysis,.

If you follow this tutorial so far, I really want to express my sincere thanks! We are now ready for extracting the data from images into the DB.

## Perform Data Extraction and Save to DB

Before running the script, setup the environment variable of your UnderDoc API key, as the script will use the key to interact with UnderDoc.

```bash
export UNDERDOC_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Once you got the environment setup and ready, extract data to DB is easy. Just run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script make use of the [UnderDoc Python SDK](https://github.com/under-doc/underdoc-python-sdk) to interact with UnderDoc's Document Understanding API, to get the returned structured data, and then store it into SQLite DB. Depends on your laptops hardware, it will also try to run the extraction of multiple images in parallel.

The script will take some time to run. If successful, you will see output similar to the following.

```bash
python main.py
2025-04-01 12:38:25,873 - __main__ - INFO - UnderDoc Tutorial - Extract expense data from imagesand persist to DB

```

### Data Verification

To verify that the data in SQLite DB, run the following command.

```bash
sqlite3 metabase-data/underdoc.db
```

In the "sqlite>" prompt, type the following command to list the tables.

```bash
sqlite> .tables
```

You should see a table "myexpense" appear.

```bash
sqlite> .tables
myexpense
```

To list the records in the table, type the following command.

```bash
sqlite> select * from myexpense;
```

You should be able to see all expense records, similar to the following one.

```bash
sqlite> select * from myexpense;

As you can see, the sample images provided include English, Chinese and Japanese. You can also see the source image file for each record.

## Expense Analytics

Now we have the expense data from our receipt/invoice images extracted and stored in the database, now we can use Metabase to perform analytics.

First of all, we use Docker to run an instance of Metabase.

### Run Metabase Docker Container

Verify that you have Docker installed.

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like below:

```bash
docker --version
Docker version 28.0.1, build 068a01e
```

We can then start Metabase with the following command.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v <your-project-folder>/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

Replace <your-project-folder> with the folder of your project. For example, my project location is:

```bash
/Users/clarenceho/workspace/underdoc/underdoc-expense-analytics-tutorial/metabase-data

# I replace /Users/clarenceho with ~, which means user's home folder
~/workspace/underdoc/underdoc-expense-analytics-tutorial/metabase-data
```

Then the command for me is below.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/workspace/underdoc/underdoc-expense-analytics-tutorial/metabase-data:/metabase-data \
  -e "MB_DB_FILE=/metabase-data/metabase.db" \
  --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

Let's breakdown the command into more details:

- Run the container in daemon mode (the -d option)
- Expose the port 3000 from the container (so your browser can connect to Metabase)
- Mount the local folder "~/workspace/underdoc/underdoc-expense-analytics-tutorial/metabase-data" to the container's folder "metabase-data", which is Metabase DB folder. By doing this you can retain your Metabase setting when you run your container next time, and also able to access the expense SQLite DB, which is also reside in the folder (the -v option)
- Pass the environment variable MB_DB_FILE, which is used by Metabase to identify the database file location. By default, Metabase use H2 database, and the file will be stored in the /metabase-data sub-folder as well
- Give the container a name "metabase", so that you can restart it by running "docker start metabase" (the --name option)
- The image to pull from Docker hub is "metabase/metabase". Docker will pull the image on the first time it runs

You can verify whether the container is running by running the following command.

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see something similar to the following.

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
27d0ceffb29a   metabase/metabase   "/app/run_metabase.sh"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   metabase
```

You can also refer to the Docker container's log to see if the container is up and running.

```bash
docker logs -f metabase
```

You should see something similar to below.

```bash
